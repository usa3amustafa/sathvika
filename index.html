        <p class="about-desc-1 about-desc">
          My name is sathvika. I am a student at National Institute of Fashion
          Technology, currently pursuing <strong>Knitwear design</strong> course
          in Hyderabad. I draw my creative inspiration from ancient
          architecture, Indigenous flora, and chaotic Indian metropolises. In
          the long run, I envision myself running a suatinable homwgrown brand
          of ethnic wear in my country. Even though ethnic wear in India is made
          of woven fabric, I would like to explore different Knits and
          experiment with the various aspects of textile design.
        </p>

        <p class="about-desc-2 about-desc">
          During my internship at Alamwar textiles, I developed my love for
          making decorative fabrics, I began experimenting with different
          mediujs such as cushion covers and tapestry, ever since, I still feel
          there is more to explore nd will continue to explore with different
          mediums to continue my leaning journey.
        </p>

        <p class="about-desc-3 about-desc">
          On a personal note, I also want to promote Telanagana
          <strong>Khadi</strong> on a global platform and work towards improving
          rural khadi weavers living conditions and income.
